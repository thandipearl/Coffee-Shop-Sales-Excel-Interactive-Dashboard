# â˜• Coffee Shop Sales Analysis â€“ Excel Dashboard Project

This project provides an in-depth sales analysis of a coffee shop using **Microsoft Excel**. The objective was to uncover key business trends, customer patterns, and product performance in order to drive actionable recommendations for revenue growth and operational efficiency.

##  Project Overview

Using raw sales data from the coffee shopâ€™s point-of-sale system, I followed a structured approach:
- Extracted, cleaned, and transformed the dataset
- Modeled the data for analysis
- Built a fully interactive Excel dashboard to highlight peak sales hours, top products, and store performance

This analysis helps answer critical business questions like:
- When are customers most active?
- Which products generate the most revenue?
- How do store locations compare in terms of performance?
